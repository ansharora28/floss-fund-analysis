We encourage developers, researchers, and organizations to contribute and create derivative projects, ultimately enriching the ecosystem around open media metadata.\nMetaBrainz's flagship project, MusicBrainz, is an extensive, user-driven music database for artist, album, track, and release information. It supports applications like Picard for digital music libraries tagging and serves as a foundational resource with contributions from users and support from companies like Google and the BBC.\nListenBrainz focuses on recording and analyzing music listening habits, inspired by projects like Last.fm. Users can use these insights to explore trends and personalized recommendations.\nBookBrainz is an open database for book metadata, similar to MusicBrainz but tailored for literature, cataloging authors, works, editions, and other entities in the literary world. This open data is invaluable for libraries, researchers, and readers seeking a community-driven book database.\nThe MetaBrainz Foundation‚Äôs commitment to open-source is integral to its mission. All software including the tools, APIs, and data structures, is released under open-source licenses.

In the multi-ethnic countries of the Global South, millions of children are unable to read or learn effectively due to critical shortages of quality local language reading resources. \n StoryWeaver from Pratham Books addresses the book gap by providing an open repository of quality storybooks in multiple languages to promote reading acquisition among children. Simple tools embedded on the platform allow users to further translate and version books for localized requirements and publish these resources on StoryWeaver, creating a multiplier effect and amplifying impact. This has led to a massive increase of local language books on the platform with 65000 books available in over 370 languages, which have been read over 200 million times in 150 countries. Of these, 58% are in minority and indigenous languages, where books are scarce or non-existent and where children have often read a book in their own languages for the first time. This kind of scale has been possible through our communities of practice model. Nurturing these communities lets us distribute our ability to solve for literacy through a societal platform. \n While the platform is digital, the books are available in multiple formats to overcome the issue of digital access and can be read online, offline or downloaded and printed. StoryWeaver is recognised as a Digital Public Good by the Digital Public Goods Alliance as India's first vetted digital public good for early reading. \n StoryWeaver is built on Rails, a web application framework with its front-end on ReactJS.

Yet, the platform struggles with performance at scale as certain technologies in the overall architecture turn outdated. Partnerships with CBSE and Punjab Education Dept.,  saw a huge increase in daily traffic and a 100x spike in concurrent users creating stories. This underlined the need for updating our creation and access microservices to robustly serve users. \n The World Economic Forum has predicted that 1.1 bn Indians will have access to the Internet by 2030, with 80% primarily using mobile devices and accessing language content. To reach the next generation of internet users, content creation and access must be designed to serve needs of the underserved communities, ensuring that new users are not just connected but empowered. To this effect, we have made structured investments into technical capacities to onboard communities, such as supporting Unicode for the Chakma language, enabling the Chakma community to write their first-ever story on StoryWeaver. Suchana, a community organization, created a unique multi-year program that took Santali children from their home language to the school language to English. StoryWeaver helped support bilingual formats and publishing of stories with 3 different scripts for Santali - Bengali, Olchikki & Devanagiri. \n This grant will help StoryWeaver complete our technology migration and open-source our inclusively designed stack that allows for creation, translation, publishing and dissemination of content in 300+ languages.

With this realization, we built a Free and Open Source Software called DIGIT (Digital Infrastructure for Governance & Inclusive Transformation). It consists of reusable services (e.g., authentication, payment, workflow) that enable a multi-tenanted platform-based architecture. The ecosystem reuses these services to build solutions that digitize public service delivery at speed and scale. \n \n Since then, the ecosystem has built 50+ solutions on DIGIT, across 10+ sectors (Health, Sanitation, Water, Legal, Climate, etc.), impacting over 2+ billion lives globally, sometimes with eGov's support. eGov maintains DIGIT's open Core, and enables the ecosystem to build and deploy solutions on DIGIT. For example, eGov supported SELCO in building an incident management system for solar grids. This is live and being rolled out across 12 states in India. Many private sector players are building on DIGIT independently. For example, one of the System Integrators has set-up a DIGIT Practice of 150+ people in India and has built 10+ solutions in multiple sectors such as Industrial Estate Mgmt, Inland Water Transport Mgmt. \n \n DIGIT needs to be governed and managed in keeping with OSS community best practices to ensure that it is closer to the needs of the people (contributors) and sustainable beyond eGov as sole maintainer.

Create opportunities for non-code contributors (e.g., documentation, marketing, user testing) to build a diverse community. Celebrate and reward contributors by acknowledging their work in newsletters, community calls. \n 3) Create educational content and learning pathways for users at different skill levels such as how-to guides, certifications and recognized courses to motivate community members to deepen their knowledge on DIGIT and contribute more effectively. \n 4) Establish community-led governance for DIGIT Core through code contribution, code reviews, dedicated maintenance, regular feedback sessions, etc."", ""repositoryUrl"": {""url"": ""https://github.com/egovernments/Digit-Core"", ""wellKnown"": ""https://github.com/egovernments/Digit-Core/blob/master/.well-known/funding-manifest-urls""}}]}"

We created the project with a deep concern for the direction of the planet and environment.\n\nIt is a normal HTTPS browser (thats 44% faster than Firefox) but also has a secondary P2P internet. If I type in aol.com it will go to the main website. If I type in aol it will take you to a 404 page where you can purchase the domain. After the site is purchased you can upload a folder and save the checksum to the blockchain. Every time a user searches for your domain their client will look for a 7z folder with the same checksum as noted on the blockchain and download it from peers. If you want to change the website you just upload the new folder and save again (It costs 0.1 cent in Glimmer to do this). Each user is then prompted to download the new version from peers.\n\nThe project includes PyrETH - a web3 alternative that is 16x smaller in size than the original and embedded in the browser. It also includes Polkadot extrinsics for cross chain compatability natively. We created this to make injected web3 code much more intuitive and faster for web developers. The DNS server is hosted on Moonbeam and allows for instant purchase and reselling of web domains. Uploading updated websites costs a fraction of a cent for web owners and is done with a simple upload dropbox in the DNS panel.\n\n\nA strange fact...\n\nThere are 200 million active websites and the average size of them is around 2mb. In total this is around 400 terabytes only.\n200,000,000 x 2MB = 400TB\nIt costs around $3000 to buy a 500 terabyte harddrive - The entire hosted internet (excluding image/video data) could fit on $3000 worth of storage!\n\nUsing 7zip compression we can lower the total figure to 240 terabytes. This is nothing! ...and yet the hosting industry totals to around $600bn. Google, Microsoft and Amazon use around 60tWh of energy each year. This is more than the bottom 170 countries in the world"", ""repositoryUrl"": {""url"": ""https://pyrebrowser.com/repo"", ""wellKnown"": null}}]}"
